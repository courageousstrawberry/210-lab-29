Unable to correctly read data from file
- Corrected this by using istringstream and 
by ignoring the commas when parsing

Map object wouldn't contain the first value of the temperature
- Fixed parsing to ignore whitespaces when reading from file

Used indexes to acess map values when trying to print out the map
- Switched to using iterators to access these values

Stored the year 2002 instead of 2024 as the current year
- Changed the year of the planet object

Local time wasn't changing through the simulation
- Added an increment time function to increment the local time as
the simulation progressed

Current year wasn't changing
- Added a function to set the year
- Increment the year by 3 after each simulation run
