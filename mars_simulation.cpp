// Define a class to represent Mars as a planet
    // Private variables: current temperature, distance from sun, season

// Define main function
    // Initialize a map to store Mars climate data for each year
        // Each key contains an array of lists for surface temperature, sun distance and rock abundance

// Open an external file to read initial data about previous climate conditions on Mars
        // If file does not open, print an error and exit

    // Read data from file and populate map
        // For each line, extract surface temperature, sun distance, and rock abundance data

    // Close the file

    // Begin a time-based simulation for environmental changes
        // Randomly pick an index for a year on the map, these will be the starting conditions
        // For 30 time intervals (each time interval represents 3 earth-years)
            // Randomly pick an index from 1-3,
                // 1 represents a dust storm
                // 2 represents a volccanic erruption
                // 3 represents measuring data
            // Depending on the index, simulate current changes on the planet
                // If it's a dust storm, reduce the temperature and rock abundance value (erosion of rocks)
                // If it's a volcanic erruption, increase the temperature and rock abundance value
                // If it's measuring data, display and add new data to the map
            // Once changes have been simulated, display the potential effect of these changes on the spacecraft
                // Spacecraft breaks down (can't withstand heat), etc.

            // Wait or pause briefly to simulate the passage of 3 years between intervals
// End of main function
