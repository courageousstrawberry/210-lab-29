First, I input some testing data into my data file.
I use error handling to try to figure out what the issue
with opening the file and reading the data.

When I create the main body of the simulation, I will add
setters and getter functions to my Planet class.

I will also add separate functions for each simulation of
a dust storm, a volcanic erruption, and the spaceship collecting
more data.

For the function to collect data, I need to create a function that
will properly take user input, check user input validity,
and store the data in the map object.

The test for my collect data function, through output statements, will
make sure that the map object is correctly referenced in the function
(instead of creating a new map), and it will then verify that all data 
was stored correctly in the map object.
